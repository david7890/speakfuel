    "content": "Learning how to greet people and introduce yourself is one of the most fundamental skills in any language. In English, there are many different ways to say hello and introduce yourself, depending on the situation and who you're talking to.\n\nFormal greetings are used in professional settings, with people you don't know well, or in situations that require respect. Informal greetings are used with friends, family, and in casual situations.\n\nWhen introducing yourself, it's important to consider the context. In a business meeting, you might say your full name and your job title. In a casual setting, your first name might be enough.",
